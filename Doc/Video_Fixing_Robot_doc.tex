\title{Repairing Vido With FFMEPG By Extracting Every Good Frame And Re-Rendering The Video}
\author{Christopher Andres \\IT Anylist\\KSDK, St. Louis}
\maketitle

If you are given a video file that is courpt, it may be possible to excract the frames from the video, and render a file that can be played. The down side is that you will not have audio, or will have to resync the audio track later.

I used FFMPEG on Ubuntu for Windows 10, though you should be able to use FFMPEG for Windows.

\begin{verbatim}
ffmpeg -i 'BOMBER OBRIEN SURVEILLANCE.mp4' -r 1/1 $filename%03d.bmp
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
ffmpeg -r 5 -i %03d.bmp -c:v libx264 -vf fps=25 -pix_fmt yuv420p out5.mp4
\end{verbatim}
